# EQMOD-WiFi
An ESP8266 based WiFi to serial, WiFi to UDP, tested on an EQ6 mount

## Introduction
This project describes a WiFi interface used between the EQMOD/SynScanPro software and the DB9 TTL serial interface connector on the Skywatcher EQ6 mount.

## EQMOD - Serial  

The EQMOD serial interface needs two WeMos ESP8266 devices - one at the host end and one at the mount end. ESP_NOW protocol is used to ensure the connection is fast.  
The WeMos device firmware uses ESP_NOW protocol to receive and send the data from/to the EQMOD serial port. At the mount interface, it sends and receives at 3.3v level to/from the EQ6.  

## SynScanPro - UDP  

On a Windows/Mac/Android/Apple device, you can use the mount interface in the SynScanPro app. By selecting UDP mode, the mount will work in either access point (mount is an AP) or station (mount joins the local network) modes.  
UDP mode and AP/STA modes are selected by jumpers/switches on the mount interface.  
In station mode, the ssid and password needs to be changed in the firmware. Later revisions may include the ability to do this OTA.  
The SynScanPro interface uses UDP to send and receive data to and from the WeMos device. The WeMos device sends and receives the data at 3v3 level to the EQ6 mount.  

It has only been tested on the EQ6 mount.  
In theory, any host system that sends/receives the EQMOD serial data stream via UDP will work with the mount device.  

## Software

The software is in the DualDevice directory.  
ESP28266SerialServer is the firmware for the mount interface.  
ESP28266SerialClient is the firmware for the host serial inetrface.  
The software can only be classed as an alpha release as it has only been tested by me on my EQ6 V2.04 mount.  

## Notices
This interface uses sample code from several ESP8266 arduino repositories.  
There are numerous HowTo videos and support groups for ESP8266.    
Sample circuits are described, but and araduino based ESP8266 is the simplest approach.  
  
**Some WeMos devices have problems downloading. Search the discussion groups first.**   

*I use genuine WeMos devices and have not experienced the reported issues, which presumably come from copycat devices. I also use Visual Studio for arduino development which may use different download software and interfaces.* 

Below are the Fritzing schematics and breadboard. Take care as I have not verified it, but it follows my prototype.
