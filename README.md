# EQMOD-WiFi
An ESP8266 based WiFi to serial, tested on an EQ6 mount

## Introduction
This project describes an WeMos interface used between the EQMOD software and the serial interface connector on the Skywatcher EQ6 mount.
It has only been tested on the EQ6 mount.
## Notices
This interface uses sample code from the ESP8266 arduino repositories. There are numerous HowTo videos and support groups.  
Some WeMos devices have problems downloading. Search the discussion groups first.
I use genuine WeMos devices and have not experienced the reported issues, which presumably come from copycat devices.
