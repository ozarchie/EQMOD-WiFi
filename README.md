# EQMOD-WiFi
An ESP8266 based WiFi to serial, tested on an EQ6 mount

## Introduction
This project describes a WeMos interface used between the EQMOD software and the serial interface connector on the Skywatcher EQ6 mount.
It has only been tested on the EQ6 mount.
## Notices
This interface uses sample code from the ESP8266 arduino repositories. There are numerous HowTo videos and support groups.  
Some WeMos devices have problems downloading. Search the discussion groups first.
I use genuine WeMos devices and have not experienced the reported issues, which presumably come from copycat devices.  
I also use Visual Studio for arduino development which may use different download software and interfaces. 

Below are the Fritzing schematics and breadboard. Take care as I have not verified it, but it follows my prototype.
